# Welcome to my small projects repository!


# Description

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have built while learning the concepts of programming. These projects are meant to be simple and demonstrate my understanding of basic programming principles and techniques.

You will find a variety of projects in this repository, including small scripts and programs written in languages such as Python, c and C++. Each project includes a brief description of what it does and any relevant instructions for running or using it.

I hope that these projects will provide a useful resource for others who are also learning programming or just want to see some examples of basic programming concepts in action. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out or open an issue on the repository. Thank you for visiting!
